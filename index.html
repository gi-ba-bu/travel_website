                    12 Interesting Facts about Japan
                  </a>
                </h3>
                <p class="text-base text-body-color leading-relaxed mb-7">
                <ul class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-transparent">
                  <li>Japan consists of 6,852 islands. The islands were originally attached to the
                    eastern coast of
                    Asia, until
                    tectonic activity caused them to split off, creating the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.
                  </li>
                  <li>The Japanese language orders words differently than we do in English.
                    Instead of ordering
                    sentences by
                    subject-verb-object (example: I write words), Japanese uses subject-object-verb (example: I words
                    write).
                  </li>
                  <li>Over a thousand tame sika deer roam the streets of Nara, Japan. Once
                    considered heavenly
                    creatures, the
                    deer are now
                    classified as a national treasure (though some are being culled for destroying plant life), and can
                    be seen
                    bowing to
                    tourists in exchange for crackers that are sold on site.</li>
                  <li>From the 12th century to the demise of feudalism in the 19th century, the
                    samurai were a powerful
                    warrior
                    class in
                    Japan. A samurai essentially had a license to kill, with the authority to strike down any commoner
                    who
                    compromised their
                    honor. Ritual suicide (known as seppuku) was a respected practice for a samurai who brought dishonor
                    to his
                    lord.</li>
                  <li>The bow is an important form of greeting in Japan, and Japanese people work
                    hard to perfect it.
                    The depth
                    of the bow is
                    significant—lower bows indicate more respect.</li>
                  <li>The kimono is a traditional Japanese garment worn by both men and women. It
                    consists of a long
                    robe-like
                    dress that is
                    wrapped around the body, with the left side always covering the right. The obi is the belt that
                    keeps the
                    kimono secure.
                    A single kimono can cost over $10,000.</li>
                  <li>Geisha, known for their elaborate hairstyles and white makeup, have been
                    entertaining in Japan
                    since the
                    18th century.
                    The white powder covers most of the geisha’s face and neck, though unpainted spaces creating a W
                    shape is
                    usually left
                    on the neck, which is considered alluring.</li>
                  <li>Traditional Japanese rooms are tiled with Tatami, or mats made with rice
                    straw. A mat’s length is
                    always
                    twice its
                    width, and its size is standardized depending on the region. For that reason, room size is often
                    indicated
                    by the number
                    of mats needed to cover the space.</li>
                  <li>Japan is home to the Japanese macaque, or snow monkey, which lives in colder
                    climates than other
                    primates.
                    The Nagano
                    Prefecture is known for its macaques, who bathe in hot springs in the winter.</li>
                  <li>The world’s largest seafood market is the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. The
                    market employs over
                    60,000
                    people and opens
                    at 3:00 am most mornings, with its famous wholesale tuna auctions beginning at five.</li>
                  <li>Japan will be hosting its second summer Olympics, and its fourth overall, in
                    Tokyo in 2020. The
                    motto for
                    the Games is
                    “Discover Tokyo,” and the mascot—chosen by Japanese schoolchildren—is a blue and white superhero who
                    has the
                    power to
                    teleport.</li>
                  <li>Japan is famous for its immaculate gardens, which are meticulously planned
                    and maintained and are
                    considered a high art.
                    “Borrowed scenery” is an important element in garden design; it means the garden’s landscape
                    includes
                    elements from
                    outside its boundaries, such as mountains, to form a backdrop.</li>
